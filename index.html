        <h2>Favorite Band - Turnpike Troubadors</h2>
        <p>
            They make good music that reminds me of the music that I <b>listened to growing up.</b>
            The way that they turn stories into music resembles what I enjoy about older songs.
            Overall I just enjoy the way they sound and the topics that they discuss.
