        <p>
            My favorite location to visit is Laramie, Wyoming. This is because this town has a diverse group of people living in it.
            It's a university town but it's also surrounded by several ranches and farms. 
            Laramie also sits just out side of Medicine Bow National Park with it only being about 30 minutes away.
